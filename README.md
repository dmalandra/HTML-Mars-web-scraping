# Welcome To Mars!

Interested in all-things Mars? Are you looking for planetary news and/or weather data?  Look no further than this repo where HTML scraping brings the info to your fingertips!

In the Mars News file, titles and previews of many articles from the mars news site are stored for review in a tidy Python dictionary.

Within the Mars Weather file, there is a bit more analysis of weather data.  We can see that one full year on Mars consists of 12 months, just like here on Earth.  However, each Martian day (sol) is equal to approximately 675 days.  Based on the location of the Mars Rover, Curiosity, the coldest temperatures occur during the third Martian Month, while the "warmest" temperatures occur during the eighth month.  Atmospheric pressure also fluctuates, averaging lows in month six and highs in month nine.

All populated DataFrames can be viewed in the attached .csv file.
